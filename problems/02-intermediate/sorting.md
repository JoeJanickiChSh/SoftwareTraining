practices: input, arrays, loops
...

- Create a class called Sorter
- Store the following numbers in an array:

```java
{ 3, 7, 10, -4, 1, 0, 8}
```

- Sort the array in descending order, and then print the sorted results.

Hint:

- Look up "bubble sort" - it's not the most efficient, but it's one of the simplest sorting algorithms

Bonus:

- Have the user enter the numbers to sort
