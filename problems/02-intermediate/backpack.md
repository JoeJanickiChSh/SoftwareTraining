- Create a class called Backpack, that stores the following information:
    - Color
    - Number of pockets
    - If it has padding
    - If it has a water bottle holder
    - How many books are inside
    - If there is a calculator inside
    - If there is a phone inside
- Properly decide which of the members are private and which are public
- Add functions for:
    - Add and remove books
    - Add and remove a phone
- Be sure that there are no impossible situations, like:
    - Removing a book when there are none in the backpack

Bonus:

- Make the functions return `bool` - return `true` if the book/phone was added/removed successfully
- You cannot add a phone if one is already in the backpack
- The backpack can hold up to five books
