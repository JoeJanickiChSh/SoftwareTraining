name: Average of Five
practices: variables, loops, arrays
...

- Create a program called `MathFacts`
- Create an array to hold five numbers
- Get five numbers from the user
- Get the average of the numbers added

Hint:

- You can create an array with `int[] arr = new int[5]`
- You can get the length of an array with `arr.length`
- The numbers should be of type `double`, to keep the decimal part of the number

Bonus:

- Print the maximum number from the array
- Print the minimum number from the array
- Print the average, maximum, and minimum numbers from the array, only iterating over the array once
