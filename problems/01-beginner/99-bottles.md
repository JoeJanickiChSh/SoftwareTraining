practices: variables, loops, conditionals
...

- Make a file and class called Bottles.
- Start a counter at 9 (for testing)
- Each time the program runs, print:

> x bottles of Dew on the wall
  x bottles of Dew
  Take one down
  Pass it around
  x-1 bottles of Dew on the wall

- Replace x with the counter, and x-1 with the counter - 1
- When there are no more bottles, print:

> No more bottles of Dew on the wall
  No more bottles of Dew
  Go to the store
  Buy some more
  N bottles of Dew on the wall

- Replace N with the number of bottles you started with, and then end the program

Bonus:

- When the counter is 1, make the program say "1 bottle of Dew" instead
- Let the user decide how many bottles to start with
