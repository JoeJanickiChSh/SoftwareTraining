# Intermediate Training
Intermediate training is meant to go beyond basic programming concepts and dive deeper into the the control system used in FRC. This includes learning advanced controls concepts like Proportional Integral and Derivative (PID) controllers, as well as more FRC specific topics such as programming the robot radios.

## Tasks
- [ ] Program the Robot Radio, read this [page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/getting-started/radio-programming.html) and follow the steps to program one of the radios.

- [ ] Update a Spark Max motor controller. Read this [page](http://www.revrobotics.com/sparkmax-software/) and follow the steps to update a Spark Max motor controller.

- [ ] Update Roborio firmware and install CTRE CAN extension. Read this [page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/getting-started/imaging-your-roborio.html) for RoboRIO firmware update.

  - [ ] The CTRE CAN Extensions require a bit more reading. Start at this [page](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), paying attention to ["What to Download (and why)"](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch05_PrepWorkstation.html#what-to-download-and-why) and ["How to prepare Robot Controller"](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch06_PrepRobot.html#how-to-prepare-robot-controller)

- [ ] Update a Talon SRX / Victor SPX motor controller. Make sure to have completed the above two steps, then read this [page](https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ch05_PrepWorkstation.html#what-to-download-and-why)

- [ ] Learn about PIDSubsystem. Read this [page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/commandbased/pid-subsystems-commands.html) and attempt to write your own PIDSubsystem. 

## [ChopShopLib](https://github.com/chopshop-166/chopshoplib)
We maintain a library of code that we use year-to-year to make our lives easier. Some of this code is meant to work around deficiencies in WPILib, while other parts add support for new sensors that we have investigated using. As a more experience member of the ChopShop software team we encourage you to get involved with maintaining this library. While we don't expect everyone to contribute to ChopShopLib directly we encourage everyone to read the documentation to find out what functionality is available.

- [ ] Read the [documentation](https://jitpack.io/com/github/chopshop-166/chopshoplib/latest/javadoc/) for ChopShopLib.

- [ ] Help write documentation for a new feature in ChopShopLib

- [ ] Suggest a new feature for ChopShopLib

- [ ] Implement a new feature for ChopShopLib
